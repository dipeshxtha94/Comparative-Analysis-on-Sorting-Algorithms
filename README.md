This is nextjs project developed along with mongodb database. This project named as 'comparative analysis on sortin algorithms' is basically comparison between three sorting algorithms like merge sort, bubble sort and quick sort. I used animation to trace the movement of the sorting process. 


## Features of this project

1.Random generated input
2.Mannual input
3.Frontend and backend
4.MongoDB database connection
5.Animation on sorting process

## Getting Started
